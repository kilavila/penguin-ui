### Introducing Penguin UI
As a dev, I've always wanted a framework that's flexible and customizable.
So, I built Penguin UI - a library of pre-made CSS classes and custom JS components.

### Speed and flexibility
Penguin UI includes a bunch of pre-designed components to get you started quickly.
No installation or CDN needed, just copy and paste. Easy to use and customize.

### Lightweight and modular
I designed Penguin UI to be lightweight and modular, so you only include what you need.
This means faster load times and better performance for your users.

### Code example

Plain HTML / CSS:
```html
<button class="btn btn-raised btn-primary">
    My button
</button>
```

JavaScript component:
```html
<pui-button pui-raised color="primary">
    My button
</pui-button>
```
