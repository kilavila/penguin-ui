# `Penguin UI <('v')>`

Penguin UI is still under development. Please check back later.

> The idea of behind this is to build a UI library that is not based on any framework.<br>
> A free collection of UI components you can use for any project, personal and commercial.<br>
> The first version of this will only function as a copy paste of HTML and CSS.<br>
> Later versions will include JavaScript and feel more like a light and simple framework.
